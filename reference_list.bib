  abstract = {In this paper we model the thermal behaviour of cellulosic materials in the presence of micro-organisms undergoing exothermic reactions. For simplicity we consider a spatially uniform model which is based upon Semenov's theory for thermal explosions. The singularity theory has been used to investigate the generic properties of the model. We consider first the case in which chemical reactions are absent, which represents heat generation in low-oxygen-containing environments. Here we show that there are two generic steady-state diagrams including one in which the temperature-response curve is the standard S-shaped curve familiar from combustion problems. Thus biological self-heating can cause jumps in the steady temperature. We then investigate the full model, which is shown to have three generic steady-state diagrams. If the energy released from the chemical reaction is sufficiently small, then the steady-state diagram may contain an elevated temperature branch, which is the feature of practical interest in facilities such as industrial compost heaps and municipal tips. If the chemical reaction is too strong the energy released by biological action increases the local temperature sufficiently high that spontaneous ignition of the cellulosic material occurs. For a given degree of chemical activity it is possible to predict the biological activity at which combustion is initiated.},

  abstract = {Plant-derived cellulosic materials play a critical role when organic wastes are composted to produce a beneficial amendment for topsoil.  This review article considers publications dealing with the science of composting, emphasizing ways in which the cellulosic and lignin components of the composted material influence both the process and the product.  Cellulose has been described as a main source of energy to drive the biological transformations and the consequent temperature rise and chemical changes that are associated with composting.  Lignin can be viewed as a main starting material for the formation of humus, the recalcitrant organic matter that provides the water-holding, ion exchange, and bulking capabilities that can contribute greatly to soil health and productivity.  Lignocellulosic materials also contribute to air permeability, bulking, and water retention during the composting process.  Critical variables for successful composting include the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, the nature of the cellulosic component, particle size, bed size and format, moisture, pH, aeration, temperature, and time.  Composting can help to address solid waste problems and provides a sustainable way to enhance soil fertility.},

In this study, two representative samples (sulfur-rich sulfide concentrate and iron-rich sulfide concentrate) were investigated for the self-heating behavior using the crossing-point temperature (CPT) method. The corresponding apparent activation energies were determined, 13.7366 kJ/mol for iron-rich sulfide concentrate and 21.3817 kJ/mol for sulfur-rich sulfide concentrate. Furthermore, the surface temperatures of sulfide concentrate stockpiles in different seasons were also measured by a thermal image apparatus. It was found the temperature for iron-rich sulfide concentrate stockpile was higher than that for rich-sulfur sulfide concentrate stockpile. These research results show iron-rich sulfide concentrate exhibits stronger propensity to spontaneous combustion than sulfur-rich sulfide concentrate. Particular attention should be paid to the fire hazard of iron-rich sulfide concentrate in daily safety check work. The combination of the CPT method with the infrared thermal image measurement provides a new approach for the risk assessment on the propensity of sulfide concentrates to spontaneous combustion during the production, storage and transportation. The useful data and experience achieved in this investigation can be also referenced in similar cases later.},

  abstract = {The increase in temperature in compost piles/landfill sites due to micro-organisms undergoing exothermic reactions is modelled. A simplified model is considered in which only biological self-heating is present. The heat release rate due to biological activity is modelled by a function which is a monotonic increasing function of temperature over the range 0⩽T⩽a, whilst for T⩾a it is a monotone decreasing function of temperature. This functional dependence represents the fact that micro-organisms die or become dormant at high temperatures. The bifurcation behaviour is investigated for 1-d slab and 2-d rectangular slab geometries. In both cases there are two generic steady-state diagrams including one in which the temperature–response curve is the standard S-shaped curve familiar from combustion problems. Thus biological self-heating can cause elevated temperature raises due to jumps in the steady temperature. This problem is used to test a recently developed semi-analytical technique. For the 2-d problem a four-term expansion is found to give highly accurate results—the error of the semi-analytical solution is much smaller than the error due to uncertainty in parameter values. We conclude that the semi-analytical technique is a very promising method for the investigation of bifurcations in spatially distributed systems.},

The results show that the factors have various effects on the composting process in different stages. At the 24th hour, the factors do not show significant effects on the composting process. At the 72nd hour when the composting process reaches active stage, the factors have important effects on the composting process, and their interactive effects are also significant. At the 144th hour, temperature and oxygen content still have effects on the composting process, but not as significant as those at the active stage.

  abstract = {Coal spontaneous combustion is an inherent problem in coal mines throughout the world. The analysis of stationary-states, including stable point and critical point, is an effective method to judge its ignition tendency. A lower critical point temperature means that it is more likely to cause fire. In the past, due to the limitation of mathematical methods, the consumption and distribution of oxygen concentration are usually neglected. In order to accurately analyze coal ignition tendency, this paper takes coal bulk as a porous system and develops an improved model by a combination of oxygen species and energy equation. The model is solved for stationary-states of the system. Qualitative analysis of the stationary-states gives a mechanism explanation for the reason why coal spontaneous ignition is hard to be extinguished and indicates that the temperature of initial endpoint and that of internal site can be uniquely determined from each other. It further points out a trend that the location of critical point moves inward as the inlet air velocity increases, which correlates well with simulation results of the existing literatures. Then, for stationary-states, calculation results of Killoch 6015 coal are obtained. Quantitative analysis of them finds a trend that the temperature of critical point rises rapidly after its slow increase. At last, a velocity range, in which the possibility of fire is extremely high, is presented by simulation computation, e.g., the range of Killoch 6015 coal is determined as 8×10−5–3×10−3m/s when the critical ignition temperature is set as 150°C.},

  abstract = {The unsteady 2D heat and mass transfer of waste piles in landfill sites in which self-heating of piped material occurs and the effect on the soil below them are studied. A simplified mathematical model that includes temperature, water content, oxygen and solute (ammonium) concentration is proposed. Inside the pile, the biological and chemical reactions increase the temperature whilst consuming oxygen. Here the solute and water content are not solved for. In the soil, ammonium leaching from the landfill site into the surrounding soil is considered. Therefore, a diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) system without cellulose consumption and with source terms is considered and only temperature, oxygen and solute concentration are solved for. An Arrhenius equation is used to calculate the effect of temperature on the solute hydrodynamic parameters of the soil. The mathematical model is solved for the ammonium, oxygen concentration and temperature in the soil by means of the finite volume method. In the soil the water content is considered to be in steady state. Comparisons between analytical and numerical results for the 2D solute equation allow the algorithm to be validated. A mesh study is carried out in order to verify the algorithms convergence and to decrease the simulation time. The effect of the soil type on energy generation and mass transfer in the pile and the soil hollow depth in which the waste pile is placed are analyzed. When the soil thermal diffusion is lower, the time over which self-heating inside the pile takes place is so shorter, as expected. The hollow depth where the waste pile is placed may be related with the solute concentration near the interface air/soil and infiltration depth in the soil. In all cases, the ammonium concentration infiltrated through the hole located in the landfill base, at the interface air/soil, on both sides, has not increased.},

abstract = "Stockpiles of organic porous materials such as biosolids, coal, compost and woodchips are susceptible to spontaneous combustion. Flow fields within such materials are induced by buoyant forces and external agents such as the wind. However, the external forces may vary on a time scale of seconds, whereas the heat, mass and momentum processes within the porous medium may occur over timescales days or months. It would be computationally prohibitive to resolve all of the timescales, hence in this paper mean external forces are coupled to the flow field within stockpiles of biosolids by means of a penalisation method. It has been determined that four variables have a profound influence of the flow fields within porous media These are the velocity of the wind, the permeability of the porous biosolids, the angle of repose of the medium and aspect ratio of the stockpile. Four distinct flow regimes within the stockpiles have been identified. A correlation has been developed to assist managers of stockpiles, which relates mean velocities within the four flow regimes with a Darcy and Reynolds number, the aspect ratio and angle of repose. The correlation is accurate for two of the four flow regions identified, but the error in predicting the two remaining regions is relatively large. However, this error is expected to have minimal impact on estimating the time for spontaneous combustion to occur."

abstract = "Self-heating or even spontaneous combustion of stockpiled coal, which is likely to outbreak under favourable circumstances during its transport, process, and storage, is a long-standing thermal dynamic hazard. This hazard is harmful in diverse aspects: causing loss of coal resource and caking property, raising safety concerns upon occurrence of open fire, and giving off noxious/greenhouse effect gases. Due to the complexity of involved physical process (e.g. heat and mass transport) and chemical process (e.g. coal oxidation), formulating an analytical solution to the problem with or even without a transient approach would be a daunting task and the problem is thus more often addressed numerically. So far many numerical models to self-heating of coal have been developed and to summarise these erratic findings, this work critically reviewed theses numerical solutions since the last four decades. Mechanism of self-heating on coal mass and low temperature coal oxidation especially kinetic modelling of coal oxidation is firstly investigated to clarify the involved physical and chemical processes. On basis of the mechanistic understanding, theoretical derivations and progressive advances on governing equations like energy, mass, and momentum conservation are reviewed and compiled in details. Through parametric studies or sensitivity check these models produced fruitful but slightly inconsistent findings. Therefore to provide industry more unbiased and comprehensive guides, the present work examined the influences of various contributors including wind flow, stockpile dimensions, coal particle size, moisture content, and packing porosity on the self-heating behaviour of stockpiled coal. Last not the least, major challenges and perspectives this subject may have are briefly discussed."

abstract = "The combustion of shale, a porous sedimentary rock, has been reported at times in outcrop deposits and mining piles. However, the initiating event of most of these fires is unknown. It could be that, under the right conditions, shale rock undergoes spontaneous exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen. This work studies experimentally and for the first time the self-heating behavior of shale rock. Because shale has high inert content, novel diagnostics such as mass loss measurements and visual observation of charring are introduced to detect self-heating ignition in respect to other self-heating materials with lower inter content. Using field samples collected from the outcrop at Kimmeridge Bay (UK) and the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of ignition, we determine the effective kinetic parameters for two particle-size distributions of shale. These parameters are then used to upscale the results to geological deposits and mining piles of different thicknesses. We show that for fine particles, with diameter below 2mm, spontaneous ignition is possible for deposits of thickness between 10.7m and 607m at ambient temperatures between −20ᵒC and 44ᵒC. For the same ambient temperature range, the critical thickness is in excess of 30km for deposits made of coarse particles with diameter below 17mm. Our results indicate that shale rock is reactive, with reactivity highly dependent on particle diameter, and that self-ignition is possible for small particles in outcrops, piles or geological deposits accidentally exposed to oxygen."

abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

Their basins of attraction (particularly that of the minimal solutions) are of great practical importance. Good estimates for the latter region are obtained by a method of spatial averaging of the nonlinear term which give very small errors for large classes of initial conditions, provided the latter are not too ‘spikey’. For ‘hot spot’ type initial conditions the method still works and gives satisfactory estimates. The bound is focussed on the critical initial energy.}

 abstract = {Experimental observations of ignition in explosive systems demonstrate that, as a rule, combustion first sets in at small, discrete sites where inherent inhomogeneities cause chemical activity to proceed preferentially and lead to localized explosions. Combusion waves propagating away from these "reaction centers" eventually envelop the remaining bulk. This study examines the spatial structure and temporal evolution of a reaction center for a model involving Arrhenius kinetics. The center, characterized by peaks in pressure and temperature with little diminution in local density, is shown to have one of two possible self-similar structures. The analysis employs a combination of asymptotics and numerics, and terminates when pressure and temperature in the reaction center have peaked.},
