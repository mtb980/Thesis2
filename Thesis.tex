% Examples:

% Figure or Scheme (caption after)

% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \input{figures/name_of_figure.tex}
% \caption[Short caption for table of figures]{Long caption for text body}
% \end{figure}

% Table (caption before)

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \caption[Short caption for table of tables]{Long caption for text body}
% \input{figures/name_of_figure.tex}
% \end{table}

%-------------- 
% A list of Figures, put after the table of contents and uncomment to activate.
% \cleardoublepage
% \phantomsection \label{listoffigures}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Figures}
% \listoffigures

% A list of Schemes, put after the table of contents and uncomment to activate.
% \cleardoublepage
% \phantomsection \label{lisrofschemes}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Schemes} 
% \listofschemes

% A list of Tables, put after the table of contents and uncomment to activate.            
% \cleardoublepage
% \phantomsection \label{listoftables}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{List of Tables} 
% \listoftables

%--------------
% Floats and centreing for tables can be a bit confusing if you have a seperate file for your tables. \begin{table}, \centering and \caption[]{} goes in the body text, *then* include the file closing with \end{table to ensure correct float placement. If you put the float and centering in the included file along with the body of the table you're going to have a bad time. Of courese, this is only if you are calling in your tables as seperate files, not leaving them in the text. Also note the american spelling of center (not the standard AU centre).

%-------------- 
% The difference between \input and \include is thus: \include creates an aux file for the included file, \input does not. \include is good for large files, like a chapter, since LaTeX won't reread the file if no changes have been made. \input is better for small inputs like data tables, since it doesn't create an aux file for the inputted file, it is read each and every time LaTeX is run. Additionally you *CAN* nest \input commands. you *CANNOT* nest \include commands.
